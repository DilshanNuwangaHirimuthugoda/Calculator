## ✨ Supported Functions

- `sqrt(x)` → Square root of x
- `pow(x, y)` → x raised to the power y (e.g., `pow(2,3)` = 8)
- `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)` → Trigonometric functions (input in radians)
- `log(x)` → Natural logarithm (ln)

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Trigonometric functions use radians, not degrees.
- `log(x)` is the natural logarithm (ln), not log base 10.
- For powers, use `pow(base, exponent)`, e.g., `pow(2,3)` for 2³.
